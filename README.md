# Internal Proxy
> With Internal Proxy, you can accelerate the development of your API. Developer would be able to start implementing code before the real API is available.
> *Internal Proxy* server can be deployed to cloud or ran locally where it will either be responding with mocked responses or forwarding calls to the real API route.

# What is supported

 - Forwarding or Mocking GET/POST Requests
 - HTTP Status Mocking

# Building

To build use `:bootRun` gradle task. Building with InteliJ will not run the buildInfo task so versioning will not work.
